WiMP - __Wi__reless __M__esh __P__roject

WiMP is a wireless mesh networking project for the Raspberry Pi that aims to build on top of a standard Fedora (Pidora) base. 

Packages will be released in RPM format, integrated with services such as systemd, and built with the portability between platforms (ARMv6, v7, x86\_64, etc) in mind.
